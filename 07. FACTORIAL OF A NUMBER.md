# FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER
## Objective: 
To develop a code to find a factorial of a number.
## Program:
```prolog
factorial(0, 1).

factorial(N, F) :- 
    N > 0, 
    N1 is N - 1, 
    factorial(N1, F1), 
    F is N * F1.
```
## Output:
```
?- factorial(5, F)
F = 120
```
## Result:
Thus, the code to find factorial of a number has been executed successfully
