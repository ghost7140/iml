# FIBONACCI OF A NUMBER
## Objective:
To develop a code to print nth Fibonacci Number.
## Program:
```prolog
fib(0, 0).    
fib(1, 1).    

fib(X, Y) :- 
    X > 1, 
    X1 is X - 1, 
    X2 is X - 2, 
    fib(X1, Y1), 
    fib(X2, Y2), 
    Y is Y1 + Y2.
```
## Output:
```prolog
?- fib(3, Result).
Result = 2

?- fib(5, Result).
Result = 5
```
## Result:
Thus, the code to print the Nth Fibonacci number has been executed successfully
