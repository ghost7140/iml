# TRAVELLING SALESMAN PROBLEM
## Objective:
To develop a code to solve Travelling Salesman Problem
## Program:
```prolog
route(Town1, Town2, Distance) :- 
    road(Town1, Town2, Distance).

route(Town1, Town2, Distance) :- 
    road(Town1, X, Dist1), 
    route(X, Town2, Dist2), 
    Distance is Dist1 + Dist2.

road("tampa", "houston", 200).
road("gordon", "tampa", 300).
road("houston", "gordon", 100).
road("houston", "kansas_city", 120).
road("gordon", "kansas_city", 130).
```
## Output:
```prolog
?- route("tampa", "kansas_city", Dist).
Dist = 320
```
## Result:
Thus, the code to solve Travelling salesman problem has been executed successfully.
