# CENTIGRADE TO FAHRENHEIT CONVERSION
## Objective:
To write prolog code to convert the temperature from centigrade to Fahrenheit
## Program:
```prolog
c_to_f(C, F) :- F is ((C * (9 / 5)) + 32 ).
```
## Output:
```prolog
?- c_to_f(10, X).
X = 50.0
```
## Result:
Thus, the code to convert the temperature from centigrade to Fahrenheit has been executed successfully.
