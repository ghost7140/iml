# MONKEY BANANA PROBLEM
## Objective:
To develop a code to solve monkey banana problem
## Description:
A room containing a monkey, chair and some bananas. Bananas have been hanged from the
centre of ceiling. If the monkey is clever enough, he can reach the bananas by placing the chair directly below
the bananas and climb on the chair. The problem is to prove the monkey can reach the bananas.
### The monkey can perform the following actions:
1) Walk on the floor
2) Climb the box
3) Push the box around (if it is beside the box).
4) Grasp the banana, if it is standing on the box directly under the banana.
## Program:
```prolog
% Production Rules
can_reach(X, Y) :- 
    clever(X), 
    complete(X, Y).

get_on(X, Y) :- 
    can_climb(X, Y).

under(X, Y, Z) :- 
    in_room(X),
    in_room(Y), 
    in_room(Z), 
    can_climb(X, Y).

complete(X, Z) :- 
    get_on(X, Y), 
    under(X, Y, Z); 
    tall(Y).

% Clauses (Facts)
in_room(bananas).
in_room(chair).
in_room(monkey).

clever(monkey).
can_climb(monkey, chair).
tall(chair).
can_move(monkey, chair, bananas).
```
## Output:
```prolog
?- can_reach(A, B).
A = monkey,
B = bananas

?- can_reach(monkey, bananas).
true
```
## Result:
Thus, the code to solve Monkey- banana problem has been executed successfully.
